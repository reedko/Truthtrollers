I watched people in 2020 hand over their rights like it was nothing. They were scared, and the government knew it, hell the government made sure of it. Mask up, stay home, shut down your life, don’t question it. And then roll up your sleeve and inject something into your body, or you’re the problem. If you don't get the shot, Grandma might die. And most people just… complied. What in the actual fuck?

They complied because they were conditioned. Because fear works. Because convenience works. Because “just trust the experts” works. And because they couldn't or wouldn't think for themselves, do their own research, they just went along. It was just easier to follow the fucking arrows on the grocery store floor.

And then, when study after study brought to light what a lot of us already knew, that real damage, injury, illness and DEATH could come from taking these poison injections, the world was silent. Still is. No one was held accountable. Not for the lies, the propaganda, not for people who lost their businesses. Not for the people who's family members died ALONE. NOTHING. FUCKING NOTHING.

So, shift gears slightly. Now we’re staring at something so abominable, so vile, that most people can’t even wrap their minds around it. Three million files released so far, with estimates of six million total. Information that was known YEARS ago. Things that came out in the Maxwell trial. Things investigators had looooong known before that.

Even if you never crack open an Epstein file, no one on planet Earth can say that this isn't evil in its purest form. There's shit going on that is literally inconceivable!! Real life horrors!! Are people so desensitized that they can simply shrug it off? Look at it like it's some fucking Dateline episode??

And here we are. We have access to the files. What fucking good is that doing? What has happened? Nothing. No accountability. No justice. No outrage that matches the scale of what we’re talking about. Just more distractions, more partisan screaming, more people picking teams like this is a game instead of something monstrous happening right in front of us.

The "powers that be" count on our exhaustion. They count on our division. They count on the fact that people would rather argue red versus blue than look up and realize the whole system protects itself.

If there was ever a time for both sides of the aisle to come together and demand action, it would be now. Not tomorrow. Not after the next election. Not after the next headline cycle wipes this away.

What will it take to get people to talk about doing something, instead of arguing who's team is better? (Spoiler: the both suck ass).

Excuse me if I seem a bit feed up and even despondent. People didn't care enough about their own rights, freedoms and well-being in 2020 to do anything about it. A huge amount of people put on the face diapers, and many, many people rolled up their sleeves and willingly became experiments for the all-mighty government.
I just don't see anyone caring enough now.

At this point, I think people are just complacent. Or maybe they just don't know what to do. Maybe that's it. I know I personally have no fucking clue what to do with all this.

I sat on the board of a non-profit organization that fought against the mask mandates, that fought for transparency regarding COVID, that fought to educate people. I was on that board for two years. And even though this DIRECTLY affected people PERSONALLY, it was incredibly difficult to get people involved. Protests were sparsely attended. Some people would still give in and wear a mask when it made life easier for them, etc.

And before you ask me if I have a plan, as if the fact that me talking about this means I must have a solution, which it doesn't. No. No I don't have a fucking plan of action.

But maybe if more of us could talk and discuss like adults that care about the country we live in and what we will be leaving for our children and grandchildren to deal with, maybe we could actually do something.

I wonder what it will take for people to come together and challenge the real enemy. I wonder if that is even possible.

And if we can’t come together over something this evil, then what the hell are we even doing?
