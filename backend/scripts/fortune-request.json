Hey Mom,

Nice talking to you on your drive home.  It feels good when you ask me about stuff like the Brownstone Institute.  They have a website, and some of their stuff is informational, but the institute has a pretty clear agenda.  It was formed by Jeffrey Tucker, famous for contending that children should work and that smoking is good in moderation.  But more recently, this info mill was founded after some of the principals advocated for the Great Barrington Declaration, which was a proposal to isolate only elderly people and let kids get sick during covid.  The places in the world where this was tried resulted in more deaths, among children, elderly and the general population.  It wasn't that the Declaration was adopted, it's just that it was pretty close to doing nothing, which was definitely not the way to go.  People will cite Sweden as a successful implementation of these principles, but even the establishment in Sweden agrees that it didn't work.  The idea doesn't work because herd immunity has never been established in the history of the world without vaccines.  Letting people get sick doesn't seem to be enough, it just establishes an endemic and kills the most vulnerable, acting as an outside force that shapes evolution.  And embracing that sort of evolutionary principle means we embrace selecting people for their immune response, rather than any merit or virtue or anything that makes up what I would call Human values.  But you were asking about the Brownstone institute's criticism of USAID, saying they were paying the New York Times and The Washington Post to write articles favorable to, the US government or something?  I couldn't fid the article.  Just there are so many red flags for me when I hear about this, because for some reason, misinformation curators seem bent on repeating Russian propoganda, Anti-Vax misinformation, anti "Deep State" fear-mongering and, of course, decrying censorship.  And they tie all these things together, like for example, USAID was an arm of the CIA that spread disinformation to topple governments abroad, ad that is why Russia didn't invade the Ukraine and the Ukraine is the aggressor so lets reward Russia for stealing land from another autonomous nation and if you do't believe that Ukraine is the aggressor you are a warmonger and naive about US government imperialism...

Anyway, my point is that I suspect these types of statements.  USAID was founded to help protect the US and the US economy from instabilty abroad because after world war 2 and subsequent violence, a lot of instability in the world was based on poverty, lack of opportunity, state sanctioned media, and severe human rights abuses.  So in that sense, USAID was a part of foreign policy, to try to decrease poverty, improve opportunity, foster independent media and make the world safer for Americans everywhere.  And it is pretty easy to say that since USAID manipulates foreign economies and politics ( by breaking up class structures through empowerment of the lower classes abroad, and making sure they know what is going on in their country) it is instrumental in the very same end result that the CIA is supposed to be focused on.  And although there is a lot of waste in the UN, and USAID, there is a lot of good being done.  One could argue that it is the only objective good being done in the world by the US, even though it is clearly done in the interest of the US.  And it has expanded, not in controlling governments and media as propagandists will assert, but in treating disease and thus saving lives.  

I have read a few articles from the brownstone institute but I didn't see the one you referred to.  I would like to see what they cited as evidence for such extraordinary claims.  If we are going to assert that independent media is media focused on promoting western interests, then we are going to be eliminating independent media.  And thus, promoting the ideas that such an article presents will end up ensuring that state sponsored media is the only source available in many places and thus,  censorship will become the norm.  It is so telling to me when a group like this complains about censorship when these people were present at many meetings during lockdown with Trump.  That is the opposite of censorship, that is extraordinary access.  I mean this is a common trope of disinformation every day, to use cries of censorship to, in effect, drown out opposing or consensus views.  It is a prominent tool in combatting free speech with free speech.  I mean RFK, jr was so profoundly censored that his propaganda website , Childrens Health Defense, increased its readership by some 8 fold, RFK, Jrs income also increased by some 8 fold over this time, and, undeniably, he got enough followers to get a sizable percentage of voters to follow his failed presidential bid into Trumps electoral coffers.  Crying censorship seems like it have bee a very successful marketing strategy for a lot of fringe voices.

Hey Mom,

It was really nice talking to you on your drive home — I always appreciate when you bring up things like the Brownstone Institute. It means a lot that you're curious about some of these sources, especially since they can be a bit tricky to navigate.

The Brownstone Institute has a professional-looking site, and some of their content includes legitimate policy critiques, but it's worth knowing that they have a strong ideological slant. It was founded by Jeffrey Tucker, who’s known for advocating for minimal government intervention in public health and the economy. In the past, he’s expressed views like supporting child labor deregulation and downplaying the risks of smoking in moderation — positions that are definitely outside the mainstream [¹][²].

Brownstone rose to prominence around the time of the COVID-19 pandemic, especially after its founders promoted the Great Barrington Declaration. That declaration argued for a “focused protection” strategy — shielding only the vulnerable while allowing the rest of society to return to normal. While it was framed as a compassionate and science-based approach, most public health experts and epidemiologists strongly opposed it, saying it wasn’t realistic or ethical in practice [³][⁴].

Some point to Sweden as a model for this strategy, but even Swedish officials have admitted their early hands-off approach led to higher death rates, especially among older populations. In the end, the promise of “natural herd immunity” without vaccines didn’t pan out — both scientifically and ethically. Historically, herd immunity has only been achieved through widespread vaccination (like with polio or smallpox), not by letting a virus run its course [⁵][⁶].

Regarding what you mentioned about USAID and their supposed ties to outlets like the New York Times or Washington Post — I wasn’t able to find the specific article either, but I’d love to look at it if you have a link. That kind of claim raises a few red flags for me. It’s not that we shouldn’t scrutinize government agencies — we should — but sometimes these stories get tangled up in larger narratives that echo disinformation tropes (e.g., “everything is the Deep State,” or “all mainstream media is state propaganda”).

It’s true that USAID has a complicated history. In the Cold War era, some of its programs were aligned with U.S. foreign policy interests, and yes, there were overlaps at times with intelligence operations. But its main mission — then and now — is to reduce global poverty, support democratic governance, and improve public health, often by working with independent media and grassroots organizations. In many cases, they’re actually working to support free expression, press freedom, and open societies, not silence them [⁷][⁸].

There are certainly legitimate critiques of how aid is distributed, and like any large organization, USAID has made mistakes and faced issues of inefficiency. But overall, it’s widely regarded as a stabilizing force that improves lives — especially through things like vaccination programs, emergency food aid, and disease prevention.

That’s why I’m always cautious when I hear sweeping claims about USAID being the puppet master of the press. Extraordinary claims need extraordinary evidence, and the Brownstone Institute tends to cite opinion pieces or like-minded blogs, rather than robust sources or peer-reviewed data.

It also feels a little contradictory that some groups who regularly had direct access to White House briefings — or who were prominently featured on talk shows and podcasts — claim to have been “censored.” For example, RFK Jr.’s platform Children’s Health Defense grew enormously during the pandemic, and his fundraising success reflects that. Whatever else we might say about the media landscape, it seems like these "censored" voices often have bigger megaphones than ever [⁹].

Anyway, thanks again for asking about this. I always enjoy when we get to have these kinds of conversations. If you do find that article, send it my way — I’d really love to dig into it with you.

Love,
[Your Name]
